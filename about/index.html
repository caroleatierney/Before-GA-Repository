			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I have always enjoyed math and computer science.  I got my first computer when I was 10.  It was the Commodore Vic-20. I studied Math and Computer Science at SUNY Cortland.  In 1994 I moved to Boston and landed my first programming job with Anderson Consulting working on their Business Process Management contract with Filene's Basement in Wellesley where I met my husband.  Three years later I started working at PartyLite Gifts in Plymouth, MA as a Senior Programmer and soon became a Project Leader.  I was responsible for the Order Entry System and worked on the Warehouse Software modules as well, travelling to their European Headquarters in Heidleburg to implement new warehouse management software.  I left Partylite in 2000 to start my family.  When my second child was 6 months old, ParyLite hired me as a contractor.  I worked in this roll until 2016 when they had a large layoff. I switched careers briefly and now I am planning to get back into software engineering.  I missed coding terribly.  I am building a new skillset and hoping to land an entry level job in the Boston area. I now have four children and we live on the South Shore of Massachusettes with out pet Guinea Pig, Gus and our Mini Austrailian Shepherd, Nina. In my spare time I like to cook, garden and make homemade cold process soap.</p>
